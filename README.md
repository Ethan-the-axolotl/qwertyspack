Pack of public e2s  
## tSG and qwerty's Christmas Lights!
### Major Features:
- Highly customizable string lights (not actual lights) that you can use on your coaches for a festive flair.  
- Manual method of [prop2meshing](https://github.com/shadowscion/Prop2Mesh)! Please use this feature, otherwise it is 129 holos for one strand, and I know you can't restrict yourself to just one strand.
### 3 color options:  
- Red and Green  
- Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue  
- White  
### There are also a couple of sequences that they can run:
- Every-other light blinks.
- 3 moving lights with a gap, and 1 moving light with a 3 light gap.
### Upcoming Features:
 - Commands to generate the p2m mesh automatically.

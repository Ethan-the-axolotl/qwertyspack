## tSG and qwerty's Christmas Lights!
### Major Features:
- Highly customizable string lights (not actual lights) that you can use on your coaches for a festive flair.  
- Manual method of [prop2meshing](https://github.com/shadowscion/Prop2Mesh)! Please use this feature, otherwise it is 129 holos for one strand, and I know you can't restrict yourself to just one strand.

- Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue

- The RG, RGYB and W can be on, off, and an alternating pattern.
- The RGYB are special, and have two extra sequences. 3 moving lights and 1 moving light.
### Upcoming Features:
